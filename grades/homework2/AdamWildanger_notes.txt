Adam Wildanger, Homework 2.

2.5: correct
2.6: correct
2.9: correct
2.12: The E-field result does not have the right units (the surface integral is equal to q_enc/eps_0)
2.16: This problem should be done with Gaussian surfaces in cylindrical coordinates.  The graph and each result are incorrect.
2.18: Think about the result we obtained before, from the Gauss' law worksheet.  The field goes as r, but the field point is a distance r_+ from pos. sphere, and r_- from neg. sphere
2.25: 
	(a) correct, but I don't see the E-field calculated from the gradient
	(b) Needs to be integrated from -L/2 to L/2 (anything symmetric) and I'm having a hard time reading the integral
	(c) I think this is done right, but I have a hard time following.  The final answer is right if I take the gradient I get the right E-field.
2.29: This is almost right but remember the delta function is the thing that gets rid of the integral.

Final Score: 10/16

Keep after it, this can always be polished and re-submitted.
