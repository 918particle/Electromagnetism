Adam Wildanger, Homework 5.

5.14, 5.16, 5.17, 5.19, 5.20, 5.23, 5.26

5.14: correct if you substitute I_{enc} = I (s/a)^2 (which you found in the middle).  I don't understand the 1/(a-s) dependence at the end, though.
5.16: correct
5.17: correct, but there are three parts to the problem?
5.19: not quite: the correct-est answer is that the surface doesn't matter.  Because div J is zero, the surface integral is independent of the surface.
5.20: I think that for your final speed, the units got turned around. The speed is like 0.01 cm/s.  But the algebra is right, though.
5.23: The integral is not setup correctly: it's dz/sqrt(x^2 + z^2) so the result is logarithmic
5.26: correct, but make sure you don't show someone ln(x) if x has units, make sure it's ln(x/a), even if a is arbitrary and can be 1.0 meter.  For part be it's rho^2 - constant^2 ...

Final Score: 13/16

These were hard-won points, but I'm proud of you and I can tell you're studying, well done.
