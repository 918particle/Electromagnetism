Kiyoshi Matsuoka, Homework 1.

1.54: I see the volume integral, but I don't see the surface integral check (-1/2)
1.55: correct
1.56: I see the line integral, but I don't see the surface integral check (-1/2)
1.57: I'm looking for this problem but I don't see it in the PDF? (-2)
1.59: I see the volume integral but not the surface integral check (-1/2)
1.62: For part e), I see the result of the c-vector, but the proof needs to be finished (-1/2)
1.63: I don't see the part about the general form of r^n (-1/2) (maybe I can't read it...)
1.64: For this one, I don't see some of the work, but the Laplacian formula in spherical coordinates is where you want to start (-1)

Final Score: 11/16

Good job on a hard assignment.  I want you to keep polishing this assignment and resubmit whenever you are ready.
