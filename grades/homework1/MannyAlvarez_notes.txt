Manny Alvarez, Homework 1.

1.54: Though I see the divergence volume integral, I don't see the surface integral to check the divergence theorem. (-1)
1.55: correct
1.56: correct
1.57: I don't see the forth and final leg of the line integral, but I do see the curl integral (-1/4)
1.59: I see both surface integrals done, and I see the divergence calculation, but I don't see the volume integral (-1/2)
1.62: For part (a) I see the integral set up but not finished. For part (c) I don't see the full argument yet.
1.63: correct
1.64: part (b) is wrong (-1/2), otherwise it's all correct.

Final Score: 13.75/16
