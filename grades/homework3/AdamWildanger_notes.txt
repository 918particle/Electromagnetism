Adam Wildanger, Homework 3.

2.43: Correct
2.50: Correct, except it turns out the total charge has to be zero.  I think there is a missing factor of r in an integral...
3.1: correct
3.3: For this one, you have to look up the Laplacian for spherical and cylindrical, and drop two of three terms in each, keeping only the r and s terms, respectively.  Then, you will find equations that have familiar solutions...
3.13: I get why you toss either the sines or cosines, but in this case the solution has sines with even integers that are not multiples of 4
3.14: Again on the right track, but it turns out that you can't just set y=0 (I'm having a hard time reading it).  The solution for sigma is eps_0 dV/dx as you write, but V is a sum of functions...
3.15: Can't read the final answer but I see that in the beginning you have exp(-kx) times sinusoids.  It's actually either sinh or cosh because exp(kx) isn't ruled out as part of the solution.

Final Score: 12/16

Keep after it, I know you can finish these off!  Focus on 3.15 if you do circle back, and consider the Cartesian examples in Ch. 3.3 as a good baseline
