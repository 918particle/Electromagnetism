1.54: correct
1.55: correct
1.56: correct
1.57: correct, but I don't see the check of Stoke's theorem by doing the surface integral
1.59: correct
1.62: for part (c), i don't know what you mean by the gradient of a vector.  otherwise, correct in all other parts
1.63: correct
1.64: correct

2.5: correct
2.6: correct
2.9: in part (a) I don't understand what you mean by S ... you formed the divergence correctly but didn't evaluate it.  part (b) is correct, so you must have had rho(r')...
2.12: correct
2.16: correct
2.18: correct
2.25: correct
2.29: correct

2.43: correct
2.50: correct

for the potential problem involving switching q to -q, your explanation sounds like the solution manual, but you don't do any mathematics to show it.  Have you seen the solution manual?

3.1: correct
3.3: correct
3.13: correct
3.14: correct
3.15: correct

4.1: correct
4.7: this is almost correct, remember we have to bring both charges in from infinity, not just integrate from r to r+d: so it's infinity to r and infinity to r+d
4.10: correct
4.15: correct
4.18: correct
Ex. 4.2: correct

5.14: correct
5.16: correct
5.17: correct
5.19: correct
5.20: I don't see part (d)
5.23: correct
5.26: I think I ended up covering this one in class, where the hint was that you draw the Amperian loop parallel to A (the current) and then go along s, then antiparallel, then -s, then close the loop.  Argue that since A(s) is only a function of s, that the +/-s sides cancel, and you get the ln(s/s_0) part.  Its derivative goes as 1/s, like the wire from Ampere's law.

7.12: correct
7.15: not quite.  The E-field should fall as 1/s for outside, and grow as s for inside
7.34: correct

C'est finit!  Well done, and thank you for getting this in on time.  I appreciate how you showed your work.
