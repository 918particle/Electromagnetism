Kiyoshi Matsuoka, Homework re-submission

5.14: Everything is right except the B-field inside should go as s-squared in the second case.  Current goes as current density times area, not circumference
5.16: correct
5.17: correct, and part c turns out to be the speed of light
5.19: correct, but the specific reason is that the divergence of J is held at 0.  Later on in the book we allow it to be non-zero.
5.20: correct
5.23: correct
5.26: correct

7.12: correct
7.15: correct, but what happens if the loop is larger than the solenoid radius?
7.34: units issue: remember that B fields act like mu_0 current / distance

well done!  Thanks for doing all this work and I also enjoyed your final presentation.  have a great spring semester
