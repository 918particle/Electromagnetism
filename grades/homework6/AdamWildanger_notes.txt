Adam Wildanger, Homework 6.

7.12, 7.15, 7.34

7.12: correct
7.15: The E dot dl line integral is equal to the magnetic flux -> E inside goes as s, not s squared.  The E-field outside is not zero, because the line integral still contains the flux of the solenoid (but it doesn't grow with s).
7.34: correct

Final Score: 14/16

Great work!  And thanks for a great semester
