Striker Herb, Homework 4.

4.1, 4.7, Example 4.2, 4.10, 4.15, 4.18

4.1: correct
4.7: correct
Ex. 4.2: this is on the right track, but how does this relate to the polarization density P?
4.10: correct
4.15: Part a) since there is no free charge, it's ok to say D = 0.  There is bound surface charge, sure, but D doesn't need to know that.  I think actually parts a and b are switched around here.
4.18: correct

Final Score: 15/16

Well done, thanks for your hard work!
