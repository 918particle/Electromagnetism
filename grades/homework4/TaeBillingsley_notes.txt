Tae Billingsley, Homework 4.

4.1, 4.7, Example 4.2, 4.10, 4.15, 4.18

4.1: correct
4.7: correct, but I'd like to ask you about the last line because I'm not sure why it's there.
Ex. 4.2: I didn't find this one...missing?
4.10: correct
4.15: correct
4.18: correct ...

4.6: Bonus! You got the bonus point, and it involved the method of images, which I didn't get a chance to cover.  Maybe this can be part of your final project?

Final Score: 16/16 (the bonus minus the missing example)
