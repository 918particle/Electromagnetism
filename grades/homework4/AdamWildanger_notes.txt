Adam Wildanger, Homework 4.

4.1, 4.7, Example 4.2, 4.10, 4.15, 4.18

4.1: correct
4.7: For this one, use the angular definition of work, and you know what the torque is ...
Ex. 4.2: Well done!  Did you notice how the answers can be expressed in terms of P?  You find that the potential outside is in fact a dipole potential, which is interesting.  This is if you say p = 4/3 pi r^2 P
4.10: correct
4.15: It looks like you are getting E ~ 1/r, but it's in an integral form.  You can't really do that without knowing all the bound charge and P, but using D = 0 (no free charge), you see that E ~ P, and P is given. E outside turns out to be zero because the bound charges cancel.
4.18: Having trouble reading here, but your final answers all look correct.

Final Score: 14/16

Great job, keep up the good work!
