\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Maxwell's Equations govern the electromagnetic fields that constitute electrodynamics.  However, an understanding of Maxwell's equations must be built from the fundamental building blocks of vector calculus, bound and free electric charge, electrostatics and electric potential, magnetostatics and magnetic vector potential, and the continuity of free and bound current.  These building blocks will be presented in the traditional order, as shown in \textit{Introduction to Electrodynamics} by D. Griffiths.  Although the course culimates with the presentation of Maxwell's Equations, special topics will be covered along the way.  These include multipole expansions, Fourier transforms and Fourier analysis, and numerical simulation methods.

\textit{\textbf{Pre-requisites}:  Calculus-based Physics 1-3, Calculus 1-3, and Modern Physics.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Course credits, Liberal Arts Categorization}: 3.0 Credits, None} \\
\textit{\textbf{Regular course hours}: MWF 10:00-10:50, SLC 228.  \textit{Zoom ID/pass}: 796 092 0745 / 667725. } \\
\textit{\textbf{Instructor contact information}: Email: jhanson2@whittier.edu, Zoom ID / pass: 796 092 0745 / 667725, YouTube: \url{www.youtube.com/918particle}, Book office hours: \url{https://fgucmvjkylvmgqfsco.10to8.com}} \\
\textit{\textbf{Office hours}: Please use the booking service to schedule Zoom meetings for office hours and advising.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Attendance/Absence}: As this is an advanced course, there is no attendance policy. Students will hold themselves accountable, and the chances of passing the course increase substantially with regular class attendance.} \\ 
\textit{\textbf{Late work policy}: Late work is generally not accepted, but is left to the discretion of the instructor.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Text}: Introduction to Electrodynamics, 4th ed. by D. Griffiths - \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Electrodynamics}}. \\
\textit{\textbf{Grading}: There will be weekly homework sets worth 50 percent of the grade, typically due Mondays.  Homework problems are challenging in this subject, and some collaboration is expected.  There will be in-class warm-up problems that will be graded for completion, and worth 10 percent of the grade.  There will be one midterm exam worth 20 percent of the grade.  There will be no final exam for the course.  Instead, there will be a final project, plus a presentation to the class.  The project will be worth 20 percent of the grade.  See Tab. \ref{tab:grading}.}

\textit{\textbf{Grade Settings}: $<60\%$ = F, $\geq 60\%, <70\%$ = D, $\geq 70\%, <80\%$ = C, $\geq 80\%, <90\%$ = B, $\geq 90\%, <100\%$ = A.  Pluses and minuses: 0-3\% minus, 3\%-6\% straight, 6\%-10\% plus (e.g. 79\% = C+, 91\% = A-)} \\
\textit{\textbf{Homework Sets}: Five to ten problems per week, assigned and collected on Fridays via Moodle PDF submission.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Final projects}: The final project will involve one of two types of topic: A) a more lengthy or challenging problem to teach the class, or B) a computational electromagnetism (CEM) example.  The final presentation should be longer, approximately 20 minutes.  Students should begin gathering and/or sharing data early on in the course to facilitate creation of the final presentation.  The presentation can be in traditional format or as a digital storytelling project.  For digital storytelling projects, Whittier College has a site license for the online video editing package WeVideo.  A short WeVideo tutorial will be given as part of the course.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Statement on Disability Services}: Whittier College is committed to make learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you experience physical or academic barriers due to a disability, you are encouraged to contact Student Disability Services (SDS) to discuss options. To learn more about academic accommodations, please email disabilityservices@whittier.edu.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Mental Health Resources:} Counseling services for enrolled students are offered at no charge and will be offered remotely during periods of remote learning. When we return to campus, in person and remote/telehealth services will be offered. Schedule an appointment by emailing counselingcenter@whittier.edu  or by phone, 562-907-4239 (between 8am â€“ 5pm; M-F). For support after 5pm, you may call the After-Hours RN Telephone Advice Line at 562.454.4548 (press option 1); for mental health emergencies contact Campus Safety at 562-907-4211; Digital mental health platform at \url{https://you.whittier.edu/}} \\ \\
\textit{\textbf{Changes due to COVID-19}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Class will meet daily using the Zoom web-conferencing until February 21st, 2022.  Class time will be used to review course status, homework, student questions, and work examples.  Content will also be delivered via the reading and video tutorials on the instructor YouTube channel.
\item It is critical that students take advantages of one-on-one meetings with the professor.  Please book an appointment time via 10to8.com: \url{https://fgucmvjkylvmgqfsco.10to8.com}.  Appointments may be used for homework help, example problems, polishing of final project ideas, and general help with the course.
\end{enumerate}}
