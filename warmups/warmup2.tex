Review of two important vector calculus theorems in two dimensions.

\noindent

\section{The curl of a gradient of a scalar function is zero}

Let $f(x,y)$ be some scalar function. Show that the curl of the gradient of $f(x,y)$ is always zero.  That is, show that

\begin{equation}
\nabla \times (\nabla f) = 0
\end{equation}

Would anything change if the proof was done in three-dimensions?

\section{The divergence of a curl of a vector function is zero}

Let $\vec{f}(x,y)$ be some vector function of $x$ and $y$ only.  Show that the divergence of the curl of $\vec{f}(x,y)$ is always zero.  That is, show that

\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times f) = 0
\end{equation}

Now try the proof in three dimensions: $\vec{f}(x,y,z)$.
